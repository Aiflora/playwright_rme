The option for customers to register their cards directly on their phones, instead of filling out a form at the store, has streamlined the process, making it more convenient for both our employees and customers. We find Recardme to be smooth and intuitive, and we're extremely pleased with the results we've witnessed thus far.\n","secondFeedback":"We've experienced a 70% boost in wine delivery orders and a 20% increase in the average check size since introducing a system to educate our customers about our selection and remind them to place orders through push notifications. This technology has truly transformed our business, and we can't help but wish we had it during the COVID-19 pandemic. Keep up the excellent work!","thirdFeedback":"The push notification feature has proven to be incredibly useful in filling up empty time slots. The fact that I no longer have to print stamp cards is a significant plus. Overall, it's a fantastic tool for my business.","fourthFeedback":"The Geo-Tag feature from Recardme has unquestionably revolutionized my shop. Situated downtown, my business frequently depends on foot traffic from individuals running daily errands and attending meetings in the area. With the Geo-Tag feature, I can remind these customers about my shop and the current Flavor of the Day as they pass by. Thank you, Recardme, for this innovative solution!","fifthFeedback":"Recardme has had a significant\n impact on our sales, particularly\n during non-peak hours. By offering\n double stamps for each coffee\n purchased during the late afternoon,\n we\u0026apos;ve seen an increase in customer traffic during this time.\n Additionally, our coffee bean sales\n have increased since implementing a\n system of sending weekly push\n notifications about the latest\n roast. Overall, Recardme has been a\n valuable asset to our business.","sixthFeedback":"We were on the verge of closing on\n Sundays due to consistently low\n sales. However, since implementing a\n strategy of advertising discounted\n oyster coupons on social media\n throughout the week, we\u0026apos;ve seen a\n drastic improvement in business on\n Sundays. In fact, we are now\n frequently fully booked on what used\n to be our slowest day of the week.\n Recardme has been a lifesaver for\n our Sunday sales.","seventhFeedback":"I used to keep track of pre-paid gym\n sessions in my iPhone notes, which\n was inconvenient and unprofessional.\n Since implementing Recardme, my\n customers can now access their\n pre-paid sessions directly from\n their Apple Wallet. This has made it\n much easier for me to manage and has\n improved the overall customer\n experience. I also appreciate the\n ability to include useful links\n about exercise and nutrition on the\n back of the cards. Recardme has been\n a valuable tool for my business.","ninthFeedback":"I highly recommend using Recardme\n for your business. We recently had\n our grand opening and used Recardme\n to offer a promotional coupon for\n double hours (up to 100 hours) for\n all new clients. We marketed this\n offer on Instagram and were thrilled\n to see 126 people redeem it.\n Recardme was a huge success for our\n grand opening and we are very happy\n with the results.","tenthFeedback":"Push notifications have proven to be\n our most effective communication\n channel in terms of conversion rate.\n We\u0026apos;ve been pleasantly surprised by\n the number of people who add our\n products to their wallets through\n Instagram and Facebook ads.

On\n average, a push notification through\n the platform will result in 30\n bookings within a few hours. It\u0026apos;s a\n quick and effective way to promote\n our events and drive ticket sales.","thirteenthFeedback":" Recardme has had an immediate and\n dramatic impact on our business,\n resulting in a 300% increase in\n newly issued cashback cards.
